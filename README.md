It demonstrates how each method is implemented.

## Key Features:
- @Autowired annotation-based dependency injection
- Constructor-based dependency injection
- Setter-based dependency injectionField-based dependency injection
- Using @Bean annotation in configuration files for defining beans
- Test cases
